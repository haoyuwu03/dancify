Dance Choreography Simplification to Stick Figure Overlay

Learning dance choreographies from youtube videos would be made easier if the dance movements were simplified to the movements of a stick figure overlayed on top of the original dancer. 

Dancify uses OpenPose's COCO model to track the locations of body joints in each frame of a dance video, and draws stick figure lines connecting these joints with different colors to distinguish the right and left side of the dancer for further clarity.
